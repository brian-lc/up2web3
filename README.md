# up2web3
Get your files uploaded to Web3 fast, and with style ðŸ¦‘


## What is this?
This repo contains the project files, code, contracts, and instructions on how to setup and run your own up2web3 client. There is/will be a hosted version you can find at *insert address here*.

## What does it do?
Well, the high level concept is to turn any file (image, movie, pdf, chunk of text) into a fully decentralized browser friendly web page. So people can upload shareable content to the decentralized web (web3) every file you upload through this client will:
 - Store the file on IPFS/Filecoin using Web3.storage
 - Create a database table to track all your uploaded files and meta-data about them using TableLand
 - Create a Ceramic DID for your published content, and your own Ceramic stream so you can share your feed with friends, view friends upload feeds.
 - Create a mini-web site so that the content can be viewed/presented how you decide through the use of customizable HTML templates (also deployed to IPFS)
 - Fork your friends feeds/content and remix into your own.
